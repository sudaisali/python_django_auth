Persona is Shutting Down
========================
Mozilla has announced that `Persona will be shutting down November 2016`_.
django-browserid `relies on the Persona service`_ and will stop functioning
properly once Persona is shut down. While it is possible to self-host Persona
and configure django-browserid to rely on your own instance, this is difficult
and not recommended. See the wiki page linked above for recommended alternatives
to Persona for authentication.
